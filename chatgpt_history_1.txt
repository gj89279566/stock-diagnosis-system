Q: Can you tell me the news about Russia and Ukraine conflict?
A: As of June 1, 2025, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine remains intense, with significant developments occurring in both military operations and diplomatic efforts.
🇷🇺 Russian Military Actions
Bridge Collapses in Bryansk and Kursk: Two separate explosions caused bridges to collapse in Russia's Bryansk and Kursk regions, both bordering Ukraine. In Bryansk, a passenger train derailed after debris from a collapsed overpass struck it, resulting in seven deaths and injuries to at least 76 people. In Kursk, a railway bridge exploded, causing a freight train to fall onto a road and injuring three workers. Russian authorities are treating both incidents as criminal acts, with some officials suggesting Ukrainian involvement, though Ukraine has not claimed responsibility.

This buildup includes North Korean soldiers and veterans of recent counteroffensives. Military analysts suggest Moscow aims to reclaim territories lost during Ukraine's 2022 counterattack and capture more ground, particularly in the Sumy and Kharkiv border regions.
